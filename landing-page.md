# StudyStreak Landing Page Design

## 1. Hero Section

*   **Background:** Full-screen section with a clean, modern gradient from a deep blue (`#4A00E0`) to a vibrant purple (`#8E2DE2`).
*   **Layout:** Centered, with ample whitespace.
*   **Headline:**
    *   Text: "Stop Cramming. Start Streaking."
    *   Font: A bold, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Gilroy).
    *   Size: Extra large, commanding attention.
    *   Color: White.

    *   Text: "The gamified study app that makes learning addictive. Track progress, crush exams, and learn languages—all in one place."
    *   Font: Same sans-serif, but in a lighter weight.
    *   Size: Medium.
    *   Color: A slightly off-white (`#EAEAEA`) to create a subtle hierarchy.

    *   Style: Large, rounded button with a soft shadow.
    *   Color: A bright, contrasting color like a vibrant green or yellow to pop against the gradient.
    *   Hover Effect: Slight scale-up and brighter shadow.
*   **Phone Mockup:**
    *   A high-quality, front-facing smartphone mockup (e.g., iPhone or generic modern device).
    *   The screen displays the app’s main dashboard: a clean UI showing a user's current streak, XP, and upcoming tasks.
    *   The mockup should have a subtle floating animation to feel dynamic.
